# 📈 Polymarket Trading Bot & Data Tracker

This project is a Python-based collection of scripts designed to interact with Polymarket markets. It focuses on market data collection, trade logging, and experimentation with automated and multi-strategy trading workflows. The primary goal of this repository is learning, research, and experimentation rather than production-grade trading.

⚠️ Note: This is an experimental and educational project. Review the code carefully before using it in any real or live trading environment.
